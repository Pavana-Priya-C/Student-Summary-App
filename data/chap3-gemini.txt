A writer named Fowler is disappointed to find that his secret agent contact, Ausable, is a fat man with an American accent. However, Fowler's disappointment turns into excitement when a spy named Max enters Ausable's room, demanding a vital report. Ausable quickly convinces Max that the room has a balcony, even though there is no such balcony, and Max escapes through the window. Fowler is shocked to learn that the police were never called, and Ausable explains that there was never a balcony, leading Fowler to realize that Ausable outsmarted Max and saved the report.
