In the 25th century, a museum curator tells the story of how a book of nursery rhymes saved Earth from a Martian invasion. A Martian leader, Think-Tank, plans to conquer Earth but gets distracted by a book he mistakes for a sandwich. He orders his crew to listen to the book, but they hear nothing. When they look at the book, they see pictures and code. Think-Tank believes the Earthlings are advanced and about to attack Mars. He orders a retreat, leaving Earth untouched.
