Tricki, a spoiled dog, is overfed by his rich owner and becomes very sick. The vet, Mr. Herriot, takes Tricki to his clinic to help him recover. Tricki lives with the other dogs at the clinic and gets lots of exercise, which helps him lose weight and become healthy again. His owner, Mrs. Pumphrey, is very worried about him and keeps sending him gifts and treats, but Mr. Herriot makes sure Tricki stays on a healthy diet. In the end, Tricki is healthy and happy, and Mrs. Pumphrey is relieved and grateful.
